Welcome to my site, stranger! I am Kai, aka katze, aka kunfoo. Some things about me:

- I am a free, libre, open source software enthusiast. I run Linux since ~2006.
- I work in IT Security since ~2017.
- I love cycling. I try to ride my [bikes]({filename}/pages/fahrrad/fahrrad.md) whenever I can.

I was born in the former GDR and grew up near the city of Cottbus. I studied in Berlin and Darmstadt, worked and lived
in Heilbronn for a while and moved to the city of Dresden in 2020. I like Dresden, even though I don't like the
political situation in Saxony at all.

I believe in the power of science and education. I strive for the political equality of all people and for solidarity
among people. I consider myself a humanist.
